### This fork is about RS232 hardware handshaking and increased throughput. 

It will not work 'out of the box' on machines that has not been modified to also include the RTS/CTS signals 
and updated the RS232 level shifter chip as described below.

The 48 models are natively rs422, but in this fork, we [currently] uses the rs232 interface instead.
#### For the 48 models, the following needs to be done;
* Add a 1+1 channel isolator chip to unpopulated position U31 e.g. ADUM121NOBRZ-RL7. Note; put a piece of kapton tape on pads 2 & 3, since they shall not be soldered to the board pads, but instead be connected to the wires described below.
* Add a rs232 level shifter capable of 1mbit e.g. SN65C3232EDR to unpopulated position U33.
* Add a few SMD 100nF caps around U31 and U33 on the unpopulated posistions.
* Add a 4 pole through hole mount JST connector (board uses China brand Yeonho Electronics SMW250/SMH250 throughout, so if you have those at hand that would be nicer, but the JST are very similar in all aspects but the locking).
* Pull two wires from an unpopulated U18 pin 4 & 1 (SO8) (rs485 transciever) to pin 2 & 3 of the new isosolator chip. These are the RTS/CTS signals.
* Move the 0R resistor from position R132 to position R131. This is, since the 48 uses rs422 natively.

With this change, you will no longer have the extra rs232 for debug available, if this is important for you. If if is, the debug could instead be moved to the rs422 interface.

Note that the only thing you need to do, if you want to revert back to rs422, is to move the resistor back to position R132. 

#### For the 36 models, which already have the rs232 you need to;
* Change position U33 to something faster.
* disconnect pin 2 & 3 on U31 from board pads.
* Pull the two wires as described.

## STM32/CHMT Notes

To build, follow normal smoothie build process to get setup.  Then checkout chmt branch and rebuild.

### Port Status:
* mbed hooks - Added, compiles, tested
* stm32f4xx libs - Added, compiles, tested
* timers - Ported, compiles, tested
* wdt - Ported, compiles, tested
* gpio - Ported, compiles, tested
* adc - Ported, compiles, tested
* pwm - Ported, compiles, tested
* build scripts - Added, project builds successfully

### CHMT Status:
* config file - 48VB Complete
* pin map - 48VB/36VA Complete
* operation/verfication - All System Functions Operational (excl. axis encoders)
* machine testing - 48VB All Systems Operational

### TODO:
* DONE: Target initialization and board bringup (clocks, mpu, etc)
* DONE: Verification of ported peripherals (step generation, watchdog, gpios)
* DONE: Debug/Comm uart setup
* DONE: CHMT controller specific configuration

### Notes/Caveats/Gotchas:
* smoothie mbed was ancient, so the oldest stm32 mbed available was integrated to reduce friction -- incompatibilities, and bugs from dated mbed may have been introduced
* MRI (gdb over serial) is not supported on stm32, use SWD/JTAG
* config file must be hardcoded into firmware build

### Next Steps/Priority
* CHMT Pinout Reversing -- Complete
* CHMT Config File Development -- 48VB Complete
* CHMT Machine Testing -- All Base Functions Operational, Long term and stability testing required.
* Synchronize System GCODEs to OpenPNP standards
* Stability Testing Required.
* WDT rewrite for longer timeout

# Smoothie

## Overview
Smoothie is a free, opensource, high performance G-code interpreter and CNC controller written in Object-Oriented C++ for the LPC17xx micro-controller ( ARM Cortex M3 architecture ). It will run on a mBed, a LPCXpresso, a SmoothieBoard, R2C2 or any other LPC17xx-based board. The motion control part is a port of the awesome grbl.

Documentation can be found here : [[http://smoothieware.org/]]

NOTE it is not necessary to build Smoothie yourself unless you want to. prebuilt binaries are available here: [[http://triffid-hunter.no-ip.info/Smoothie.html|Nightly builds]] and here: [[https://github.com/Smoothieware/Smoothieware/blob/edge/FirmwareBin/firmware.bin?raw=true|recent stable build]]

## Quick Start
These are the quick steps to get Smoothie dependencies installed on your computer:
* Pull down a clone of the Smoothie github project to your local machine.
* In the root subdirectory of the cloned Smoothie project, there are install scripts for the supported platforms.  Run the install script appropriate for your platform:
** Windows: win_install.cmd
** OS X: mac_install
** Linux: linux_install
* You can then run the BuildShell script which will be created during the install to properly configure the PATH environment variable to point to the required version of GCC for ARM which was just installed on your machine.  You may want to edit this script to further customize your development environment.

## Building Smoothie
Follow this guide... [[http://smoothieware.org/compiling-smoothie]]

In short...
From a shell, switch into the root Smoothie project directory and run:
{{{
make clean
make all
}}}

To upload you can do

{{{
make upload
}}}

if you have dfu-util installed.

Alternatively copy the file LPC1768/main.bin to the sdcard calling it firmware.bin and reset.
